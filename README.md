# Artemis
Artemis is the main project worked on by this organization. It is a tool for Rainbow Six: Siege - Shadow Legacy intended to bring a bunch of different modifications to the game.  
It is also intended to bring support for user made extensions, providing an intuitive and easy to use framework to work with.
